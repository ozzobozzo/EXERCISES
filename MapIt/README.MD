# Project: mapit.py with the webbrowser module

This program gets a street address from the command line arguments or clipboard and it
opens the web browser, loads Google Maps page and searches for the address.

The webbrowser module lets users save a few clicks when searching the web. 
There is no need for manually opening the browser, directing to a website and entering an address. 



## Motivation

This program is part of my learning process about web scraping with Python.



## How To Run

Open the command line, navigate to the folder that contains this program, enter 'python mapit.py' and provide an address as an argument.

You can also copy the address and store it in the clipboard, and then run the program. In both cases,  the Google Maps page with provided address will open in the browser.
